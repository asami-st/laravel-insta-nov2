 SOFT DELETE -> is like removing/deleting the user
 from application, but the data of that user is still available in the database.

 Result:
    -> The users posts, comments, profile, etc. will hidden/not being displayed in the application.

 Why do need SOFT DELETE?
    -> We don't want to totally remove the users yet from the application. Meaning, that if we want to restore/activate the user back again, then we easily do that because we still have the data of the user in the Db.
 How?
    we are going to create a "deleted_at" column in the users database table.
